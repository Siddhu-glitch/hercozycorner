      <p>
        Periods aren’t just about physical discomfort — they can be a storm of emotions, pain, and quiet strength. You carry all of this with such grace, and you deserve a moment to just be.
      </p>
      <p>
        To every girl out there: You don’t need to be okay all the time. You don’t have to power through or wear a brave face. You're allowed to rest. You're allowed to pause. You're allowed to say, "this is hard" and still be proud of yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        This space is for your softness, your silence, your sighs. For your tears and your laughter. For your craving to be understood without having to explain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you’re lying in bed, curled up with cramps, feeling overwhelmed, or just seeking comfort — this space holds you gently. With no expectations. With no judgment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here’s to hot water bottles, cozy socks, chocolate bars, gentle words, and long naps. To being strong in your own quiet way. To being real and raw and entirely enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are not alone. You are deeply cared for. You are valid — exactly as you are. 💗
      </p>
